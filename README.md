##### **Java Caesar Cipher**



A simple, console-based Java application that encrypts and decrypts messages using a Caesar Cipher. This project was built to practice and demonstrate fundamental Java programming skills.



###### **Features**



* **Encrypts \& Decrypts:** Supports both scrambling (encryption) and unscrambling (decryption) of messages.
* **Custom Shift Key:** Allows the user to provide any integer as a shift key for the cipher.
* **Handles Alphabet Wrap-Around:** Correctly wraps from 'Z' back to 'A' during shifts.
* **Preserves Formatting:** Retains capitalization, spaces, numbers, and all punctuation from the original message.



###### **How to Run**



1. **Clone the repository to your local machine:** git clone https://github.com/H1SH4M11/java-caesar-cipher.git



2\. Navigate into the project directory and the src folder.



3\. Compile the .java file:

&nbsp;  javac CaesarCipher.java



4\. Run the compiled program:

&nbsp;  java CaesarCipher





5\. Follow the on-screen prompts to either encrypt or decrypt a message.



###### **Skills Demonstrated**



* **Java Fundamentals:** Core language syntax, variables, data types.
* **User Input/Output (I/O):** Reading user input from the console using the Scanner class.
* **Control Flow:** Using loops (for) and conditional logic (if/else) to process data.
* **String \& Character Manipulation:** Using StringBuilder for efficient string building and methods from the Character class.
* **Algorithm Logic:** Implementing the core cipher algorithm using modulo arithmetic to handle character shifts.
* **Version Control:** Project managed with Git and hosted on GitHub.
